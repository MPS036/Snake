Snake (Pygame)

A classic Snake game implemented with Pygame, including wrap-around movement (crossing one border teleports the snake to the opposite side).

Features:
(i) Grid-based Snake gameplay
(ii) Wrap-around field boundaries (no wall collisions)
(iii) Food spawning outside the snake body
(iv) Self-collision detection (game over + restart prompt)

Controls
Arrow keys to move (↑ ↓ ← →)

Notes:
(i) Reverse direction (180° turn) is prevented to avoid instant self-collision.
(ii) Game over restarts the snake after confirmation.
