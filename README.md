# 🐍 Snake (Pygame)

- A classic Snake game implemented with Pygame, including wrap-around movement (crossing one border teleports the snake to the opposite side).

## ✨ Features:
- Grid-based Snake gameplay;
- Wrap-around field boundaries (no wall collisions);
- Food spawning outside the snake body;
- Self-collision detection (game over + restart prompt).

## 🕹️ Controls:
- Arrow keys to move (↑ ↓ ← →)

## 📌 Notes:
- Reverse direction (180° turn) is prevented to avoid instant self-collision;
- Game over restarts the snake after confirmation.

## 🛠 Requirements:
- Python 3.x;
- Pygame.
