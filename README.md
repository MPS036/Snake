🐍 Snake (Pygame)

A classic Snake game implemented with Pygame, including wrap-around movement (crossing one border teleports the snake to the opposite side).

✨ Features:

(i) Grid-based Snake gameplay;
(ii) Wrap-around field boundaries (no wall collisions);
(iii) Food spawning outside the snake body;
(iv) Self-collision detection (game over + restart prompt).

🕹️ Controls:

Arrow keys to move (↑ ↓ ← →)

📌 Notes:

(i) Reverse direction (180° turn) is prevented to avoid instant self-collision;
(ii) Game over restarts the snake after confirmation.

🛠 Requirements:

(i) Python 3.x;
(ii) Pygame.
